##### Epicodus exercise using JavaScript Build Tools, 3/18/16

##### Brad Pizzimenti

## Description
An introduction to APIs, API-key best practices, and JSON parsing through use of GitHub's API. The project fetches and then parses user info form GitHub.

Secondarily, this exercise created familiarity with common JS project build tools including NPM for all build tools and their dependencies and Bower for front-end dependencies. It also introduced the transpiling of SASS to CSS and live-browser-updating.
